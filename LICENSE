The code and the pre-trained deep neural network model provided with
this repository allow one to perform vessel detection in ultra-widefield
fundus photography images and to compute various evaluation metrics for 
the detected vessel maps by comparing these against provided ground 
truth. The ralated methodology and metrics are described in the paper:
